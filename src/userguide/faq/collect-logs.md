# Collection Log Guide

[[toc]]

::: tip
The HyperBDR deployment has been completed by default.
:::

If you encounter obstacles or operation errors when using HyperBDR / HyperMotion and don't know how to handle them, collect the corresponding logs and error screenshots according to your source type and send them to us together.

> If you are conducting **[Configuration]** and have not installed and deployed Sync Proxy, Windows Agent or Linux Agent, you only need to collect the **[Console]** logs.
