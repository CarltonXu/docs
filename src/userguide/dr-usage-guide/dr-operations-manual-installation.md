## Software installation

### Installation Package Information

#### Installation Package

Access [https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest](https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest) through a browser to obtain the download package link.

#### Installation Package MD5 Checksum File

Access [https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest](https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest) through a browser to obtain the download package link. Then, add the `.md5` suffix after obtaining the link to obtain the MD5 file.

::: tip
Log in to the HyperBDR host backend and execute the command.  
:::

### Download Installation Package and MD5 Checksum File

#### Set url in Shell

```sh
# Retrieve the latest HyperBDR package URL
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE=$(curl -s -k https://install.oneprocloud.com/get_hyperbdr_latest/latest)
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE}"

# Get the corresponding MD5 file URL
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5="${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE}.md5"
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5}"

# Use string manipulation to extract the package name
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME="${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE##*/}"
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME}"

# Extract the MD5 file name
HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME="${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME}.md5"
echo "HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME: ${HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME}"
```
#### Download File

```sh
curl -k -O "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE"
curl -k -O "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5"
```
### Installation Package Consistency Check

- Step1: Generate the MD5 value for the downloaded installation package  

```sh
md5sum "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME"
```
- Step2: Check the MD5 value recorded in the MD5 checksum file

```sh
cat "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_MD5_NAME"
```
- Step3: Compare MD5 Values
 
If the MD5 values obtained in `Step1` and `Step2` are the same, it indicates that the installation package is not corrupted. If the MD5 values are different, you can try re-downloading the file for comparison or contact us for assistance.

### Install HyperBDR

> After completing the download of the HyperBDR installation package, you can proceed to install it  
> Already logged in to the HyperBDR installation host backend by default

::: tip
The operating system used for the installation must be Ubuntu 20.04 version.
:::

#### Unzip the HyperBDR installation package

- Execute the following command to unzip the installation package  

```sh
rm -rf /mnt/installer && tar -zxvf "$HYPERBDR_PACKAGE_NAME" -C /mnt/

##### Enable public access to the HyperBDR platform

- Execute the command  

```sh
bash /mnt/installer/install.sh -i <HyperBDR Public IP>

::: tip
The Public IP specified by -i can be understood as your external Internet address. Generally, in a data center, it is called an Internet IP. If it is on the cloud, it is generally called an Elastic Public IP (EIP). Obtain it according to your actual environment.
:::

##### Access the HyperBDR platform through an internal VPN
