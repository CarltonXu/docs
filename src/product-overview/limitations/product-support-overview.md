# Support Overview

HyperMotion & HyperBDR supports various production sources and recovery targets in different recovery scenarios.

The support conditions for HyperMotion and HyperBDR can be analyzed from two aspects:

## Production Host Support

First, whether the production host is supported, divided into agent mode and agentless mode.

- [Agentless Operation System Support](https://oneprocloud.feishu.cn/sheets/VRqksSPEPhRTPStp3kVcItXNnyh?sheet=0MJNYC)

## Cloud Platform Support

Second, whether the target cloud platform supports automation. If the cloud platform is not on the supported list or its API interface is upgraded and cannot be directly supported, a generic migration method can still be used. However, note that the generic method cannot meet disaster recovery requirements.
